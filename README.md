# Amazon Fine Food Reviews Analysis

## Project Overview
The **Amazon Fine Food Reviews Analysis** project aims to perform sentiment analysis and text mining on a large dataset of reviews from Amazon customers. The goal is to understand customer sentiment, identify key trends, and predict the sentiment of new reviews using machine learning models. This analysis can help businesses improve their products and services by better understanding customer feedback.

## Objectives
The main objectives of this project are:
- To perform exploratory data analysis (EDA) on the reviews to understand patterns and trends.
- To apply text preprocessing techniques such as tokenization, stemming, and stop-word removal.
- To build sentiment analysis models to classify reviews as positive or negative.
- To visualize the most common words and trends in customer reviews.
- To evaluate model performance using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score.
